# Overview

Tamnoon is a modern Elixir framework for building frontend web applications, designed to streamline and simplify development, and stay true to the principles of the language. It is built around the following core goals:

1. *Simplicity first* - Tamnoon adopts a clear, component-driven structure that reduces complexity and helps developers turn ideas into features with minimal friction.

2. *Zero boilerplate* - By removing unnecessary setup and configuration, Tamnoon enables fast, efficient development with clean and focused code.

3. *Functional by design* - Built to align with Elixirâ€™s functional nature, Tamnoon encourages a pure, declarative style that fits naturally into the language.
